# Pokedex App

Technologies used: React, Redux, CSS, Bootstrap

## About
A throwback— the design of this Pokedex app in React Redux was inspired from Pokemon cards I used to play with during childhood. Selecting a type button in the menu above will filter all Pokemons with that type, the colors of which I drew from the official website. Clicking a card will show the description of the Pokemon selected.
